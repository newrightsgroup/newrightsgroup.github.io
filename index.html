          <p>Around the world, citizens are rebelling against governments that they feel do not represent them. New technologies are enabling new forms of organization and engagement. They are transforming the relationship between citizens and institutions and influencing the expectations that people have for their role in shaping their society. Alarmingly, rather than embrace opportunities for new forms of openness and participation, governments see these movements as an existential threat and have enacted extensive controls and tracking of online and offline speech. </p>

<p>New Rights Group (NRG) engineers people-driven models to support rights and democracy based on principles of openness, participation and citizen agency. </p>

<p>We are a collective of the world’s leading technologists, activists, designers and strategists who come together around compelling questions for innovative solutions. </p>

<p>We are building a world where people create just, equitable, and responsive societies.</p>

<h3>
<a name="what-we-work-on" class="anchor" href="#what-we-work-on"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What we work on</h3>

<p><strong>We build citizen-driven societies.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Movement building</strong> – NRG supports more effective and safe movement building. Mass movements have been effective in expressing discontent and have lead to the removal of dictators. Movements need new methods to influence the construction of new institutions and to exert sustained influence in democracies. They also need ways to quickly grow their ranks in ways that don’t expose new participants to unnecessary risk.</li>
<li>
<strong>Meaningful elections</strong> – Elections are the key factor in whether a government is considered democratic. They also provide crucial opportunities for people to openly express a vision for the country, challenge the status quo, and advance reform and accountability. NRG helps citizens to demand meaningful election processes that contribute to people’s confidence in their government. </li>
<li>
<strong>Reinventing government</strong> – Citizen demands for change cannot be met simply by replacing the people in charge. Democratic institutions must evolve. NRG helps to design and implement citizen-driven governance models.</li>
</ul><p><strong>We encourage social “hacking”.</strong> The best ideas for organizing communities and countries won’t come from within NRG. We are working to create environments and culture that encourage innovation in politics, advocacy, and governing.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Internet Freedom</strong> – A free and open Internet has been one of the most democratizing and empowering tools. We aim to keep it free, open and secure. </li>
<li>
<strong>New support models</strong> – New technologies have created new opportunities for advancing new models of democracy and human rights while rendering old approaches ineffective or dangerously counterproductive. We advise donors and policymakers on providing effective and responsible support. We engineer better models to support rights and democracy. </li>
</ul>
